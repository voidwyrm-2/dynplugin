# Dynplugin

To get this working you'll either need Linux (WSL also works) or a Mac

Keep in mind this code was generated by ChatGPT but based on my research it should be correct

1. move into `dynlib`, then run `go build -buildmode=plugin -o dynlib.so dynlib.go`
2. then move into `loader` and `go build -o loader .`
3. now run the loader with `./loader`
